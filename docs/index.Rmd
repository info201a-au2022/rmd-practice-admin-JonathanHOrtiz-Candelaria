## Covid Report
Covid cases have been rising nonstop since the start of the pandemic. It has been a fairly upward trend with certain areas leveling out a bit until it starts climbing once more. As of the most recent data, total cases across the US are `r get_total_cases()`. On the other hand, the total number of US deaths are `r get_total_deaths()`. 


I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
